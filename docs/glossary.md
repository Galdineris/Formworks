## General Terms
### Component
Components are the building block of our forms. They are composed of title, description, requirement and an specification. Date pickers, text fields and selection fields are all components.
### Form
The form generated by our framework and composed of title, components and a submit button.
### Response
The data provided by the user in the form.
### Specification
All components have a specification responsible for providing the components type and its details. Things like the options for a selection component or placeholder text for a text component are specified in the specifications.

## Development
### RootViewController
A RootViewController is a UIViewController responsible for being the container of all the UI Components of a given form. This object is the one responsible for the instantiation of each UI Component and for receiving and sending data to the "outside world".
### UI Component
A UI Component is a representation of one of many types of inputs available in a form. It is composed of a UIViewController and a ViewModel, which communicates with its UIViewController through the Protocol-delegate pattern.
**A UI Component should only be instantiated as part of a root UIViewController through UIViewController containment.**
