# Coding Principles
### User Centric
We aim to improve the value proposition of our framework by putting the user in the center of our decisions. Whenever developing a new feature, fixing a bug or improving the documentation, you should always have the user in mind.
Keep in mind that our user, the developer, will also have their users.
### Simplicity
Strive to keep your code, documentation and communication simple as possible.
### Privacy
FormworksKit will not implement any kind of data collection, whether it be for analytics or any other reason.
### Asynchronous Communication
Communication should be done asynchronous in order to take into consideration contributer's schedule. Don't expect to receive an answer as soon as you ask a question.
Whenever possible, communication about PRs, and development in general, should be done through GitHub.
### Readability
Prioritize code readability over fancy abstractions.
### SOLID
Follow SOLID principles as much as possible. However, take them as guidelines and not rules.
### Testability
Produce code that is easy to test and mantain.
### Composition over Inheritance
Give preference to composition and protocols over inheritance.
