# How to Contribute
We more than welcome any and all efforts to contribute.
Follow the steps bellow and, in case of any doubt, feel free to contact the team at myformworks@gmail.com.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo.
2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's
   great to know that you have a clean slate.
3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
   require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we
   need a test!
4. Make the test pass.
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on one of the maintaners. We will try to address it as quickly as possible and may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:
* Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it
* Update the documentation, the surrounding one, examples elsewhere, guides,
  whatever is affected by your contribution
* Following to our [coding principles](Resources/coding-principles.md)
